Assignment 3
============

You’ve been given the fundamental tools to create highly interactive canvases capable of producing unique images based on the user’s input. In this assignment, you must produce an original sketch utilizing the following:


* Keyboard Input
* Mouse Input
* Screenshot Saving Capability
* A blank canvas until it receives user input, and a static canvas after input completes.

The window size for your sketch must be no smaller than 800x600 and no larger than 1280x720. Lastly, as with last previous assignments, you must include a 2 sentence (minimum) description of your artistic intent/goal for your assignment. Place this at the top of your sketch as a comment. Make sure to make line breaks appropriate so that your description is readable for your peers.
