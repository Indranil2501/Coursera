Assignment 1
=============

The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate your command over drawing basic objects in Processing. Additionally, you’ll be demonstrating your ability to install Processing, create a new sketch, add objects to the sketch, save the sketch, and copy and paste the sketch code. Do not shirk on creativity, as your peers will be reviewing your work.

You’ve been given the fundamental tools to draw objects in Processing. In this assignment, you must produce an original sketch containing at least 20 distinct objects of at least 2 kinds of shapes. Each object must be unique, in shape (ellipse, rect, etc), or in color, or in size. Although shapes must be visible on your canvas, you may include objects which are partially out of view.
