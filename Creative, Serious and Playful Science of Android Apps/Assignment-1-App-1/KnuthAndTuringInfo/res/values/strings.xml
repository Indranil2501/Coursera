    <string name="turing_name">Alan Turing</string>
    <string name="turing_desc">Alan Turing is commonly considered to be the "father" of computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing was a highly influential British mathematician and computer scientist who formalized the concept of an algorithm using the Turing machine.  A Turing machine, invented in 1936 by Alan Turing, is a device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules, and is considered the first model of a general purpose computer. Turing also designed ACE while working for the National Physical Lab, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. </string>
    
    <string name="knuth_name">Donald Knuth</string>
    <string name="knuth_desc">Donald Knuth is an American computer scientist and mathematician and currently a professor at Stanford University. He has been called the "father" of algorithmic analysis for his work on developing rigorous analysis techniques of the computational complexity of different algorithms. He is the author of the multi-volume The Art of Computer Programming, which is a comprehensive volume of books covering many kinds of programming algorithms and their analysis. Knuth is also the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system and the Computer Modern family of typefaces. In addition, he worked to develop the WEB and CWEB computer programming system which is used to encourage and facilitate literate programming.  Knuth is strongly opposed to granting software patents and has spoken his opinions on the matter directly to the US and European patent offices. </string>
