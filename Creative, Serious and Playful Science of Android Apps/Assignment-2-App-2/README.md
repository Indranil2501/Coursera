App #2: Build Something Creative!
======================
Directions for Assignment #1 taken from Coursera

App #2 can be about anything that is interesting to you but cannot be the same app you created for App #1 in this assignment. Be sure to test your app in an API level 10 emulator. Other than that, the content and functionality of the app is entirely up to you to decide! You will need 1 screenshot and a signed apk file for submission.


Briefly answer the following 4 questions:
* What does your app do?
	I created a simple ToDo list application.  The user has the ability to create new tasks, edit the names of current tasks, and mark the tasks as completed.  The tasks are saved throughout different instances of the application.
* Why did you decided to build the app?
	I picked something relatively basic that I could complete in a couple of hours that would also act as a refresher for Android application development. 
* What do you remember most about your development experience? For example, what was the hardest part of this assignment or the part that required the most time?
	What probably took the most time was getting the custom ArrayAdapter to properly work and mark the text as strike-through when necessary.
* What would you like to do next to your app?
	Change the layout and add additional graphics to make it prettier, also add the ability to drag and drop the order of the tasks.
