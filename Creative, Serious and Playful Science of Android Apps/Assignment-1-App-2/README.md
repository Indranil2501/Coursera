App #2: Build Something Creative!
======================
Directions for Assignment #1 taken from Coursera

App #2 can be about anything that is interesting to you but cannot be the same app you created for App #1 in this assignment. Be sure to test your app in an API level 10 emulator. Other than that, the content and functionality of the app is entirely up to you to decide! You will need 1 screenshot and a signed apk file for submission.


I picked something relatively basic that I could complete in a couple of hours that would also act as a refresher for Android application development.  So I created a simple ToDo list application.  The user has the ability to create new tasks, edit the names of current tasks, and mark the tasks as completed.  The tasks are saved throughout different instances of the application.
