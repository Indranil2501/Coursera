App #1: "My first steps as an Android Developer"
======================
Directions for Assignment #3 taken from Coursera

For this third and last assignment you will create 1 app using at least 4 of the concepts and ideas presented in Week 6 and Week 7.

* Your app must work on the API Level 10 emulator.
* You app must demonstrate use of a subset (at least 4) of the Android programming topics introduced in Week 6 and/or Week 7 .
* Your app should be simple but interesting, fun or useful.
* Just one java file! Your app's code should be entirely within your Activity.java file and may not use third-party libraries (other than Android's support library).
* Your app code cannot be too large – less than 300 lines (ideally 20 – 200 lines). Hint: Eclipse status line tells you your current line position.
* Your code should include comments that explains how the main functionality of your app is implemented.

I wrote a simple Madlibs ("fill-in-the-blanks") application that combines user input with pre-written text to create a little story that one can then share with their friends via SMS message.
